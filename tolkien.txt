Poem From That Letter Galdalf Wrote To Frodo
--------------------------------------------

All that is platinum does not shine
Not all those who walk around are lost
The elderly that is strong does not get weaker
Deep roots are not harmed by the frost

From the ashes a fire shall be woken
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken
The crownless again shall be king
