O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their Ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
