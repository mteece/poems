Soliloquy of Marc Antony
------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their Ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
